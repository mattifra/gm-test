Test project with react and styled-components.

## Starting the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.


## Project info

Everything is built more "atomic" as possible.
In the commons folder, I have put the most common and reusable elements like links, titles, images, articles, etc..
In the modules folder, I have put the components that will be part of the page like header, navigation and the article listing.

Enjoy!
